- To add migrations for a project go to the  package manager console in Visual Studio
	= Before executing the command switch the "Default project" in the Package Manager Console to the infrastructure project, which contains the Configurations and the DbContext.
	= Command Add-Migration Initial -o Persistence/Migrations -Context UsersDbContext
		== Use the -Context parameter if there are more than one contexts in the solution
		
- To build a docker image from a Dockerfile generated by Visual Studio check if the paths require you to use the root directory of the project.
	If this is the case than run the script in the root dir, with option to select the Dokerfile from the target folder. 
	I.E. the generated Dokerfile for the Kitchen.API had the following line:
	= COPY ["Kitchen.API/Kitchen.API.csproj", "Kitchen.API/"]
	If you execute the script in the Kitchen.API folder, powershll wont find the Kitchen.API forder since it is in the root directory. 
	To solve this you must execute the script in the root dir, with option for custom Dockerfile
	= docker build . -t testbuild -f Kitchen.API/Dockerfile
	
- You can not use the web managements interface of rabbit mq to debug mass transit because mass transit wraps 
the messages in an Envelope.

- To connect to a rabbitMQ container from a project run in IIS Express outside of a container - i.e. for
debugging, you must set the host to localhost instead of the hostname set at the creation of the container.

- If you start a project in docker for debugging through Visual Studio you should add it to the docker 
v-network manually if the network is required.

- If you make queues with different names, but publish the same message type, both queues will receive it.
If you make consumers in 2 apps for the same queue, when you publish a message it will be distributed to a consumers
on a random principle.

- If you change the Consumer`s Message type you must restart the RabbitMq server, bacause a connection can not 
be established after this. This may be caused by predefined exchanges with the old Message type, which must be
deleted, but I don`t know details about the working of the MassTransit. Its just easier to recreate the container.

- The token for withKubeConfig MUST be copied in PURE NOTEPAD NOT NOTEPAD++ otherwise its wrong. If you have 
problems you could check it by including the input step and going to the path printed by the echo command.
NOT ONLY that you have to copy it from PURE NOTEPAD but you also have to ERASE THE NEW LINES! Maybe you could
also erase them from Notepad++!!! :D

- In Jenkinsfile to use formatting you must use this format - "https//:${params.SomeParam}"!
If you use '' instead it wont work.

- If you dont have enough resources the update of the configuration may not start. If you have 3 replicas and
you want to upgrade them the cluster first must add the new ones and then remove the old ones. However if
you don`t have resources to run the 3 old and 3 new simultaneously you can`t finish the update. 
This could be solved by rolling undates, because only one new at a time is added and one old is deleted.
This is only speculation :D

- To delete unused kubernetes context (for deleted clusters) edit the config file in the userFolder/.kube
