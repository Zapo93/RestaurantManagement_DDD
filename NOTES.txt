- To add migrations for a project go to the  package manager console in Visual Studio
	= Before executing the command switch the "Default project" in the Package Manager Console to the infrastructure project, which contains the Configurations and the DbContext.
	= Command Add-Migration Initial -o Persistence/Migrations -Context UsersDbContext
		== Use the -Context parameter if there are more than one contexts in the solution
		
- To build a docker image from a Dockerfile generated by Visual Studio check if the paths require you to use the root directory of the project.
	If this is the case than run the script in the root dir, with option to select the Dokerfile from the target folder. 
	I.E. the generated Dokerfile for the Kitchen.API had the following line:
	= COPY ["Kitchen.API/Kitchen.API.csproj", "Kitchen.API/"]
	If you execute the script in the Kitchen.API folder, powershll wont find the Kitchen.API forder since it is in the root directory. 
	To solve this you must execute the script in the root dir, with option for custom Dockerfile
	= docker build . -t testbuild -f Kitchen.API/Dockerfile
